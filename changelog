  index.php
    required query string parameters: term (search entry)
    optional query string parameters: sort (sorting order, by default "weight" ("alpha" is also available))
  paginate.php
    required query string parameters:
      common for all pagination targets:
        1. term (search entry) (same as previous version),
        2. target (the pagination target, "definition" or "relation") (replaces "criterion" in the previous version)
        3. sort (sorting order) (same as previous version)
        4. page (page index) (same as previous version)
        5. per_page (number of entries per page) (same as previous version)
      if we're paginating "definition", the above parameters are sufficient
      if we're paginating "relation", an extra parameter is "type" designating the type of relation to paginate (i .e. the id of the corresponding relation type) (same as previous version)
